          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li> 
          <li>An element is any type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>HTML ELEMENTS work together to create the structure and framework of a webpage so that it may be easily navigated by users</li>
          <li>HTML will be used to build a sturdy "frame" for webpages</li>
          <li>HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frame’s building blocks. Next, we add CSS to define the style. Finally, we add JavaScript to our HTML structure to make the website interactive</li>
          <li>The charset element sets character encoding</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for the webpage</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of elements describe the content and role on a webpage</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>inline CSS = Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only… these are less flexible external and internal style sheets</li>
        <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
        <li>External style sheet keeps CCS rules in a separate file… makes changes easier and, thus, is the preferred method to style a webpage</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
        <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any [individual] element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
        <li>	Use . card class selector to style by element</li>

            <li>Index = a unique identifier, a number, assigned to individual data items in an array… allows us to find the item being looked for and, ultimately, use that individual item from the array.</li>
            <li>JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to executed over and over. </li>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions telling the computer how to perform a task... a function is created by using the function keyword followed by a unique name with () at the end</li>
