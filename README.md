# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a one stop study guide for all the new things learned in our Prework lessons. The purpose was simple: get as much need-to-know information into an easy to access, all-in-one location. A lot was learned putting this project together; a small taste of what's to come including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This project can be used as a one stop for information learned in the prework lessons. Going back to this project, we can check back on some key information about the various topics that were covered like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If a reminder of how each section/component was put together and created, we can reference this with the code in VS Code. And JavaScript can be seen using the console in GoogleDev.
